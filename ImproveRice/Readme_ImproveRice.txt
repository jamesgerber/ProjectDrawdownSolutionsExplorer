% Readme for Improve Rice


This code is being written as I transition between two more or less
reasonable ways of archiving and document.

Eventually, I intend the solutions to have the latest science,
and individual projects may use the layers and codes from
those solutions.

Here, for rice, the solution is currently static - and a beta
version, but in the context of a project ("Southeast Asia")
the science has been advanced beyond the solution as prepared for the
beta launch of the Drawdown Explorer in June of 2025.

However, I have the opportunity to create the maps for the 
improved rice solution after the solution has been reviewed, and
I'm going to base those maps of some of the more recent rice
results created for the SEAsia project.

Ideally, after the beta launch (and after Caiyu et al is
accepted for publication (currently in review at Nature Climate 
Change) we will fully update the rice solution within explorer
and update the maps again.

Until then, this code will pull in maps from the SEAsia 
body of work.
